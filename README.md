> Mechatronics, which is also called mechatronic engineering, is a multidisciplinary branch of engineering that focuses on the engineering of both electrical and mechanical systems, and also includes a combination of robotics, electronics, computer, telecommunications, systems, control, and product engineering. (Wikipedia)

<br>

The following list is a combination of various books, courses and other resources related to the mechatronic engineering. However, becuase Mechatronics is a board term that conatins many fields, the links below are fouced on the mechatronic point of view for the different topics. Additionally, resources for mechatronics applications are also listed.

It's an attempt to gather useful material in one place for everybody who wants to learn more about the mechatronic engineering.
